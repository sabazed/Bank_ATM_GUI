# Bank_ATM_GUI
Basic ATM interface for a simple bank system.
I used Java Swing and Postgresql for creating an interface and storing accounts in the database,
so the data will be saved even after closing the program and rerunning it. It's my first program
with both SQL and GUI, didn't try much to make it look better.
